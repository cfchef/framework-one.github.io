    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.5.0-rc2">second Release Candidate of FW/1 3.5.0</a> is available for testing.</p>

<p>This Release Candidate contains a few bug fixes discovered since Release Candidate 1 and is now the <a href="http://fw1.riaforge.org">default download from FW/1’s RIAForge page</a>.
I consider this stable enough to evaluate for production usage at this point – I expect this RC to be the Gold Release unless end user testing uncovers a showstopping issue in the next week or two!</p>

<p>This Release Candidate contains just bug fixes since Beta 2. Beta 2 contained mostly bug fixes since Beta 1, with one small enhancement to DI/1 (<code>liberal</code> plural support, e.g., <code>libraries</code> becomes <code>library</code>).</p>

<p>The focus of this release is integration:<!--more--></p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for controllers and services to be written in CFML (<code>.cfc</code>), Clojure (<code>.clj</code>), or Lucee (<code>.lucee</code>)</li>
  <li>Support for views and layouts to be written in CFML (<code>.cfm</code>) or Lucee (<code>.lucee</code>)</li>
  <li>Configurable folder names to set your own conventions (for <em>controllers</em>, <em>layouts</em>, <em>subsystems</em>, and <em>views</em>)</li>
  <li>Support for <code>Application.cfc</code> to use FW/1 without extending <code>framework.one</code></li>
  <li>A new, cleaner, more consistent set of conventions for adding subsystems to an existing application</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="/documentation/3.5/">documentation for 3.5</a> has been completely overhauled with complete descriptions of all the new features, as well as many
clarifications and expansions of existing features. In particular, you’ll want to check out:</p>

    <link href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/09/06/fw1-news/"/>
    <updated>2015-09-06T22:25:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/09/06/fw1-news</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of months have passed since <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/07/12/fw1-3-1-released/">FW/1 3.1 was released</a> but things have been busy behind the scenes!</p>

<p>As indicated in July, work on FW/1 3.5 had been progressing in parallel (the first time two releases of FW/1 have been worked on concurrently!) and you can already download <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.5.0-alpha2">FW/1 3.5 Alpha 2</a>.
Yes, there was an <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.5.0-alpha1">Alpha 1</a> as well, but as work progressed on the <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/3.5/">massively overhauled 3.5 documentation</a>, some important usability enhancements
appeared and a new alpha was released within 24 hours! In particular, the <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/3.5/cfml-and-clojure.html">Clojure and CFML Sitting in a Tree</a> section has been extensively updated and includes a fully worked example of
how to create FW/1 application from scratch using the REPL to create Clojure services and controllers, with CFML views and layouts!</p>

<p>You’ll also probably notice that the FW/1 website has had a facelift, finally getting the look’n’feel that Kevin Stannard designed five years ago. Better late than never, and huge thanks to Kevin again for his wonderful logo design and choice of colors!
The 3.5 documentation now includes a table of contents on each page, making it easier to navigate (this will probably get backported to 3.1 and 3.0 at some point).</p>

<p>In addition to the ongoing work on FW/1 3.5, we also have an <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.1.1">important bug fix release for the 3.1.x version</a> which addresses a potential problem with REST APIs.</p>

<p>Finally, if you’re a <a href="https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox">CommandBox</a> fan, we have good news: you can now easily install FW/1 3.1.2 and 3.5.0 (prerelease) via <code>box</code>. I’ll be blogging about this shortly. The 3.1.2 release is exactly the same as 3.1.1 (including the version number!)
but it includes <code>box.json</code> for compatibility with ForgeBox / CommandBox. In addition, Tony Junkes has contributed an <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1-commands">initial set of <code>box</code> commands for FW/1</a> that let you get up and running quickly. This will be covered in the next blog post.</p>

    <updated>2015-01-29T13:30:49-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/01/29/lucee-fw1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today saw the announcement of the <a href="http://lucee.org">Lucee Association Switzerland</a> and the release of a new open source CFML engine: <a href="http://lucee.org/downloads.html">Lucee 4.5.0</a>.</p>

<p>For background on the new engine and the association behind it, read <a href="http://blog.adamcameron.me/2015/01/lucee.html">Adam Cameron’s blog post with Q&amp;A</a> about the launch.</p>

<p>I’ve already migrated all my local test environments to Lucee and can report that FW/1 (and DI/1 and cfmljure) all run beautifully on it - and it will be my primary test environment for future development of the FW/1 family going forward.</p>

<p>I’ve also migrated my local dev environment for World Singles over to Lucee and that went pretty smoothly too (I encountered just two issues - both minor, one already fixed in Lucee’s master repository).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://bitbucket.org/lucee/lucee/wiki/Home">Lucee wiki</a> has information about downloading and installing Lucee, as well as building Lucee from source, and how to migrate from Railo to Lucee (hint: it’s really easy - stop the server, remove <code>railo.jar</code>, add <code>lucee.jar</code>, start the server).</p>

<p>Have fun with Lucee!</p>
