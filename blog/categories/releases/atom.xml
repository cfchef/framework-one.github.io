    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The thread safety issue affecting SES URLs and routes in FW/1 3.0 has been backported to the 2.2.x and 2.5.x releases so if you believe you are seeing incorrectly routed requests on either of those releases, you can update to the appropriate patch release:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v2.5.1">download FW/1 2.5.1</a> to replace Release 2.5</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v2.2.2">download FW/1 2.2.2</a> to replace Release 2.2.1 or 2.2</li>
</ul>


<p>If you are on an earlier release of FW/1 and believe you are seeing the issue that is fixed in this patch, please post on the FW/1 mailing list (I&rsquo;d rather not backport this patch any further &mdash; I&rsquo;d rather you upgraded!).</p>

<p>Once again, thank you to David Sedeño who highlighted this critical issue!</p>

<p>The symptoms you might see include incorrectly routed requests under load.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I released FW/1 3.0 about a month ago and now it&rsquo;s time to get started on the 3.1 release.<!-- more --></p>

<p>FW/1 3.1 will be primarily a maintenance release. You can read the <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/milestones/3.1">current list of changes slated for FW/1 3.1</a> on the GitHub issues page. Depending on how long it takes to get 3.1 done, additional issues may be added. And, of course, some of these issues may be slipped to 3.5 (currently represented by the <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/tree/clojure">Clojure branch of FW/1</a> in the GitHub repo and the <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/milestones/3.5">short list of FW/1 3.5 issues</a>).</p>

<p>Starting with release 3.0, the <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/">FW/1 documentation</a> will be versioned and the top-level page will always represent the latest version in development. You can read the <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/3.0/">FW/1 3.0 documentation</a> separately already. The sidebar will always show two releases (develop and master) fully linked &ndash; older versions will be listed in future, with just a link to the index page.</p>

    <link href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/02/24/fw1-3-0-released/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that after lots of user testing and almost no issues found, the Gold Release of <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.0">FW/1 3.0</a> is now available!<!-- more --></p>

<p>About two and a half weeks ago I released <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/02/06/fw1-3-0-rc-2-available/">FW/1 3.0 RC 2</a> and only one minor issue was reported (an inconsistency between <code>buildURL()</code> and <code>buildCustomURL()</code> regarding how <code>baseURL</code> was handled). That has been fixed, along with the addition of a new extension point for DI/1 (<code>metadata()</code>).</p>

<p>You can see a <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/issues?milestone=13&amp;q=is%3Aclosed">full list of issues fixed in FW/1 for 3.0</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/di1/issues?milestone=1&amp;q=is%3Aclosed">full list of issues fixed in DI/1 1.0</a> on GitHub. This represents the official release of DI/1 1.0 as well.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who has contributed to the 3.0 release &ndash; it&rsquo;s been a long time in the making! Particular thanks go to Nando Breiter for migrating the DI/1 documentation from the old wiki to the new FW/1 website. Also thanks to John Berquist, Ryan Guill, Cameron Childress, and Adam Tuttle for you code contributions and everyone who tested prerelease builds of FW/1 and reported issues and made suggestions! Thank you!</p>

    <link href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/02/06/fw1-3-0-rc-2-available/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-06T20:21:49-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/02/06/fw1-3-0-rc-2-available</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About two weeks ago I released <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/01/24/fw1-3-0-rc-1-available/">FW/1 3.0 RC 1</a> and the only real bug persisting at that point was related to <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/issues/283">DI/1 dotted path deduction</a>.</p>

<p>I think that bug is finally squashed, based on early testing by some users that had encountered the bug, so the second <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.0-rc2">Release Candidate build</a> of FW/1 3.0 is now available!<!-- more --></p>

<p>In addition to fixing that DI/1 bug, the only other change since RC 1 is some cleanup of the <code>examples</code> folder. That means this RC is almost certainly going to be gold candidate for the final 3.0 release.</p>

<p>Please download and test this version and report any issues you find. I&rsquo;d like to cut the final 3.0 release fairly soon, so I can merge <code>develop</code> to <code>master</code> and start planning FW/1 3.5.</p>
