    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I consider FW/1 3.0 to be <em>feature complete</em> at this point so I am releasing Alpha 1 for testing. I expect people to run into a few bugs &ndash; this release has some big changes in it, compared to the 2.x release stream &ndash; and it&rsquo;s possible that new feature requests will crop up during alpha testing, but everything I wanted to change is in place.<!-- more --></p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.0-alpha1">download FW/1 3.0 Alpha 1 from Github</a> and that release page has a link to <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/issues?milestone=13&amp;page=1&amp;state=closed">the complete list of closed tickets in FW/1 3.0 Alpha 1</a> although I&rsquo;m going to summarize the most important ones in this blog post.</p>

<h2>Features Removed</h2>

<p>First and foremost, some features that have been part of FW/1 from the early days have been removed. These features were deprecated in FW/1 2.5 as a migration path so I would strongly advise anyone still on FW/1 2.2.1 (or earlier) to upgrade to 2.5 in preparation for the (breaking) changes in 3.0!</p>

<p>These features include the <code>service()</code> API call and the <code>start*()</code> and <code>end*()</code> item handlers within controllers, as well as global references to <code>rc</code> (where it was not passed as an argument or made available in a view automatically). You can read more about the deprecation (and now removal) of these features in <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2014/05/25/fw1-2-5-is-released/">the release announcement for FW/1 2.5</a> on this blog. Management of services via a bean factory, with property-based injection, and direct invocation has long been considered a much better way to interact with services than using the &ldquo;service queue&rdquo; that FW/1 originally provided.</p>

<p>In addition, the recently added <code>getRC()</code> and <code>getRCValue()</code> API calls &ndash; added in FW/1 2.5 during the deprecation of global references to <code>rc</code> &ndash; have been deprecated <em>and will be removed in the final FW/1 3.0 release</em>. They were hastily added and they were unnecessary. In this alpha release, their use will trigger an exception explaining what to use instead. You can add:</p>

<pre><code>framework.enableLegacyRCAccessors = true
</code></pre>

<p>to your configuration while you update your code (this will suppress the exception but still write a message to your application server&rsquo;s console output &ndash; just as the deprecation process did in FW/1 2.5).</p>

<h2>Automatic Bean Factory Usage</h2>

<p>The other big change in this 3.0 release is that DI/1 (and AOP/1) is fully integrated. FW/1 itself moves from <code>org.corfield.framework</code> to <code>framework.one</code> alongside <code>framework.ioc</code> (DI/1), <code>framework.aop</code> (AOP/1), and some helper CFCs. <code>org.corfield.framework</code> still exists but will issue a deprecation warning if it is used. It will be removed in the final 3.0 release.</p>

<p>You can still place the FW/1 CFCs anywhere you want but if you move DI/1, you&rsquo;ll need to tell FW/1 where to find it &ndash; see below.</p>

<p>Previously, it was expected that you create a bean factory in your <code>Application.cfc</code> <code>setupApplication()</code> function and call FW/1&rsquo;s <code>setBeanFactory()</code> API to tell the framework about it. For some time, he conventional path to your <strong>Model</strong> CFCs has been <code>/model/beans</code> for your transient beans (domain objects) and <code>/model/services</code> for your singleton services (and perhaps <code>/model/gateways</code> for any data gateways, although those could just as easily live in your services folder too). That means you nearly always had the following code in <code>setupApplication()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var bf = new framework.ioc( "model" );
setBeanFactory( bf );
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if you also managed your controllers this way, you may have had:</p>

<pre><code>var bf = new framework.ioc( "model,controllers" );
bf.addBean( "fw", this );
setBeanFactory( bf );
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>addBean()</code> call ensures that the bean factory knows <code>fw</code> is an alias for your bean factory so it will be available to any controller <code>init( any fw )</code> methods when they are constructed.</p>

<p>If you use subsystems, you probably had something similar in your <code>setupSubsystem()</code> function (and hopefully you set the default bean factory as a parent for each subsystem bean factory).</p>

<p>Now, FW/1 does this for you automatically. There are new configuration options to control the details, but the default cases <em>should just work</em> and you can remove your bean factory creation code from your <code>setupApplication()</code> function. Those options are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>diEngine</code> &ndash; the type of the dependency injection engine: FW/1 knows about <strong>&ldquo;di1&rdquo;</strong>, <strong>&ldquo;aop1&rdquo;</strong>, and <strong>&ldquo;wirebox&rdquo;</strong>. The default is <strong>&ldquo;di1&rdquo;</strong>. You can also specify <strong>&ldquo;none&rdquo;</strong> to suppress the automatic bean factory machinery and <strong>&ldquo;custom&rdquo;</strong> if you want to tell FW/1 to use your own bean factory (see below). Note that ColdSpring is deliberately <em>not supported</em> as it is no longer maintained by anyone and has not been updated in years.</li>
<li><code>diComponent</code> &ndash; the default location of the bean factory CFC. For DI/1, this is <code>framework.ioc</code>; for AOP/1, this is <code>framework.aop</code>; and for WireBox, this is <code>framework.WireBoxAdapter</code>. If you move these files elsewhere, or setup a different mapping for them, set <code>diComponent</code> to that new location. If <code>diEngine</code> is <strong>&ldquo;custom&rdquo;</strong>, you can set <code>diComponent</code> to the dotted path of your bean factory for FW/1 to use it automatically.</li>
<li><code>diLocations</code> &ndash; the set of folders that DI/1, AOP/1, or WireBox will scan for CFCs. The default is <strong>&ldquo;model,controllers&rdquo;</strong> &ndash; note the relative paths! If you have these folders elsewhere (i.e., not relative to the application root), then you&rsquo;ll need to specify <code>diLocations</code>, e.g., as <code>"/model,/controllers"</code> or <code>"/myapp/model,/myapp/controllers"</code> or something similar.</li>
<li><code>diConfig</code> &ndash; additional configuration passed to DI/1, AOP/1, WireBox, or your custom bean factory. Specifically, this is the second argument to the constructor for DI/1 or AOP/1, and the <code>properties</code> argument to the constructor for WireBox, or the single argument to the constructor for your own bean factory. By default, it is an empty struct.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Additional Features</h2>

<p>In addition to the two major changes listed above, there are a number of minor enhancements compared to FW/1 2.5:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>isUnhandledRequest( string targetPath )</code> &ndash; a new API that you can override to tell FW/1 not to handle certain requests. By default, this returns <strong>true</strong> for certain file extensions and certain paths, as specified by the <code>unhandledExtensions</code> and <code>unhandledPaths</code> configuration values but you can choose to override this completely, or still call <code>super.isUnhandledRequest(targetPath)</code> and add additional conditions of your own.</li>
<li><code>redirectCustomURL( string uri, string preserve = 'none', statusCode = '302' )</code> &ndash; a new API that uses <code>buildCustomURL()</code> to construct a URL for a redirect.</li>
<li><code>buildCustomURL()</code> &ndash; now supports variable substitution: if <code>:varname</code> is present in the URI passed in and <code>rc.varname</code> exists and is a simple value, then that value will be substituted into the returned URL. To avoid confusion with subsystem paths, <code>:varname</code> will only be recognized if it follows one of: <code>/</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>=</code>, <code>&amp;</code>.</li>
<li><code>setLayout()</code> &ndash; now accepts an optional second argument, a <strong>boolean</strong>, that let&rsquo;s you tell FW/1 to automatically suppress any further layouts. This removes the need to specify <code>request.layouts = false</code> in your layout file.</li>
<li>Both DI/1 and FW/1 now try very hard to avoid attempting to autowire FW/1 itself (or the Application.cfc based on it, which acts as a global controller in a FW/1 application).</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2014/05/25/fw1-2-5-is-released/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-25T23:13:39-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2014/05/25/fw1-2-5-is-released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a migration release to pave the way for breaking changes in Release 3.0. All examples have been updated to latest best practices and now use cfcscript exclusively. Examples use DI/1 0.5.0 to manage all beans and services (as <code>framework.ioc</code>), and no longer rely on start/end actions or the <code>service()</code> method.<!-- more --></p>

<p>As always, FW/1 can be downloaded from the <a href="http://fw1.riaforge.org">FW/1 page on RIAForge</a>. Release 2.5 is now the latest stable release of this framework, as it approaches its fifth birthday!</p>

<p>For a full list of all tickets closed in Release 2.5: <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/issues?milestone=14&amp;page=1&amp;state=closed">https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/issues?milestone=14&amp;page=1&amp;state=closed</a></p>

<h2>Migration from 2.2.1</h2>

<p>The <code>service()</code> call has been deprecated, as have start/end action items. Global access to <code>rc</code> in <code>Application.cfc</code> has also been deprecated. If you just drop 2.5 into your setup and you rely on these features, you&rsquo;ll get exceptions explaining how to enable these features for backward compatibility, namely add the following to your framework configuration:</p>

<pre><code>enableGlobalRC = true,
suppressServiceQueue = false
</code></pre>

<p>The ability to enable the implicit service calls is still present via:</p>

<pre><code>suppressImplicitService = false
</code></pre>

<p>but, like the other two options, defaults to disallowing the deprecated feature.</p>

<p>If you enable these deprecated features, you will no longer get exceptions using them, but you will see deprecation warnings in your application server&rsquo;s console log. This is to remind you to update your code in preparation for 3.0 later this year!</p>

<p><em>Please note that Release 3.0 will completely remove these backward compatibility options &ndash; and the associated deprecated features. In addition, <code>org.corfield.framework</code> will move to <code>framework.one</code> in Release 3.0, alongside <code>framework.ioc</code>.</em></p>

    <link href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2013/12/18/fw1-2-2-released/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-18T22:34:03-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2013/12/18/fw1-2-2-released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Framework One version 2.2 is now available for production use! You can download it from the <a href="http://fw1.riaforge.org/">Framework One page on RIAForge</a>. This includes one bug fix over RC2 (interaction between <code>renderData()</code> and trace output).<!-- more --></p>

<p>The main focus of the 2.2 release is improved support for REST APIs, through the addition of <code>renderData()</code> to simplify returning JSON, XML and plain text results to the caller, as well as more sophisticated route handling via &ldquo;resource packs&rdquo; which let you define a family of related routes for a given resource type, using a shorthand notation. For more information, see this <a href="/blog/2013/11/03/fw1-releases-and-roadmap/">blog post about the latest FW/1 release and the roadmap</a>.</p>

<p>As noted previously, the master branch is the current stable release (2.2), and the develop branch has become the next release (2.5). 2.5 will be released next month and will be a stepping stone toward some substantial changes coming in 3.0. For more detail, read this <a href="/blog/2013/11/02/fw1-the-year-ahead">blog post explaining the changes coming in 2.5 and 3.0</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2013/11/03/fw1-releases-and-roadmap/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-03T11:38:30-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2013/11/03/fw1-releases-and-roadmap</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I released the first <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v2.2-rc1">FW/1 Version 2.2 Release Candidate</a> for testing. See below for the list of changes in this release, compared to Version 2.1. I also released a maintenance update for the old compatibility branch: <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v1.3">FW/1 Version 1.3</a> (the &ldquo;Latest Release&rdquo; label is due to Github&rsquo;s view of the world, but it is the latest 1.x release). This is the version to use if you&rsquo;re on CFMX 7, CF 8, CF 9.0.0, Railo versions prior to 3.2, or OpenBD.<!-- more --></p>

<p>In addition to these two releases, I also added milestones (and dates!) for the next two FW/1 releases: 2.5 and 3.0. There are some fairly big changes coming, including some important breaking changes. I&rsquo;ll post a follow-up with more details on <strong>why</strong> these changes are coming, but you should read the <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/issues/milestones">FW/1 Roadmap</a> and start thinking about how these changes will affect you (as well as reading the next blog post, of course!).</p>

<p>As always, FW/1 wouldn&rsquo;t be possible without all the contributions from the community. This version includes contributions from John Berquist (regex caching in routes, resource packs in routes), Marco Betschart, Chris Blackwell, Peter Boughton, Will Coleda, Billy Cravens, Mark Drew, and all those who have provided feedback via the mailing list and Twitter and IM and&hellip; Thank you!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a fairly complete change list for Version 2.2:</p>

<ul>
<li>#198 <code>renderData()</code> added for easier REST APIs</li>
<li>#197 resource pack support added to routes for easier REST APIs</li>
<li>#195 override <code>processRoutes()</code> to customize them (<code>addRoute()</code> is deprecated)</li>
<li>#192 regex in routes are now cached for improved performance</li>
<li>#181 improve null value support (Railo compatibility)</li>
<li>#179 can use <code>onMissingMethod()</code> for <code>injectFramework()</code></li>
<li>#176 <code>buildURL()</code> now correctly supports <code>?</code> at end of action</li>
<li>#175 subsystems automatically enabled if you specify subsystem configuration</li>
<li>#170 layout suppression is now correctly reset on an exception</li>
<li>#169 ensure <code>framework.home</code> is consistent with subsystem settings</li>
<li>#168 don&rsquo;t strip additional characters from start of path</li>
<li>#165 <code>onMissingView()</code> correctly called when view is missing</li>
<li>#163 trace code no longer fails if session scope is disabled</li>
<li>#160 <code>buildURL()</code> sanity checks <code>queryString</code> as struct</li>
</ul>


<p>Additional changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>fixed error message for service() missing action</li>
<li>framework initialization logic is more robust</li>
<li>improve example that uses DI/1 to avoid confusion over what to manage</li>
<li>improve consistency of framework injection (of itself)</li>
<li>layout trace shows correct path</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2013/01/05/fw1-version-2-1-released/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-05T13:23:53-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2013/01/05/fw1-version-2-1-released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>FW/1 2.1 is now the official master release.</p>

<p>The develop branch has been merged to master and the &lsquo;v2.1&rsquo; tag has been added. Work on version 2.2 will soon start on the develop branch.<!-- more --></p>

<p>Version 2.1 has been a long time in the works. Version 2.0 was released in December 2011, just over a year ago. So what has been going on in Framework One Land since then? You can play along at home by reading <a href="https://github.com/seancorfield/fw1/commits/master">the commit list for the master branch</a>&hellip;</p>

<p>January 2012 saw version 2.0.1 appear with a fix for <code>buildUrl("")</code> which was broken just before the 2.0 gold release and caught by Seb Duggan. Thank you. January also saw a patch from Daryl Banttari to improve the performance of <code>expandPath()</code> by caching, similar to how <code>fileExists()</code> was handled.</p>

<p>February brought the start of FW/1&rsquo;s MXUnit-based test suite with some stellar work by Ryan Anklam. Ryan continued that work in March, June and July &ndash; thank you! March brought a pull request from John Whish to improve application startup behavior in the face of errors in user code. In June, Matt Quackenbush contributed a nice improvement to <code>redirect()</code>: support for HTTP status codes. In July, Ryan Anklam contributed to <code>populate()</code>, providing the ability to handle child objects automatically, and Giancarlo Gomez enhanced the regex support in routes. In August, I fixed a bug in autowiring bean factories when using subsystems which was identified by Marco Betschart, and then Marcin Szczepanski substantially expanded the test suite throughout August, September and October &ndash; much appreciated! In October, I fixed a bug in how <code>setView()</code> interfered with error handling, identified by Alex Purice, and then I worked on the test suite and I test-drove the development of the new &ldquo;environment control&rdquo; feature. Peter Boughton spotted that <code>setLayout()</code> did not work inside <code>onMissingView()</code> so I test-drove a fix for that. I added the <code>unhandledExceptionCaught</code> option so you can choose to rely on FW/1 for handling errors in requests that would otherwise be &lsquo;unhandled&rsquo; by the framework (thanks to &lsquo;stubotnik&rsquo; for that suggestion). Dave Ferguson identified a nasty bug in ColdFusion 10&rsquo;s WebSocket implementation that was causing him problems with FW/1 &ndash; which I fixed by copying <code>CGI</code> variables to the <code>request</code> scope. I cleaned up <code>request</code> scope usage and further improved FW/1&rsquo;s robustness in the face of errors at startup, due to user code problems. In November, Richard Herbert found a case where FW/1 failed if <code>session</code> scope was disabled (now fixed). December was then a busy month with the addition of the new tracing / debugging facility, ensuring HTTP status code 500 is set when an unhandled exception is reported, and various small bug fixes and code cleanup in the new features added. Thanx there to Nando Breiter, Marcin Szczepanski and Chris Blackwell for finding those bugs!</p>

<p>Thank you everyone for your contributions to FW/1 &ndash; I really appreciate the assistance in making the framework better for its community! As can be seen above, it really is a team effort.</p>

<p>In summary then, version 2.1 contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>Environment Control support.</li>
<li>Application tracing.</li>
<li><code>populate()</code> now handles child objects automatically.</li>
<li>Improved regex support in routes.</li>
<li>Addition of a nice test suite, making it easier to test-drive the development of new features, as well as ensure fewer regression bugs sneak in.</li>
<li><code>request</code> scope cleanup (and removal of several <code>request</code> variables that had previously been marked as deprecated.</li>
<li>Lots of small improvements to the robustness of application startup in the face of user code problems, making it easier to debug those problems, and several enhancements to error handling in general.</li>
</ul>
