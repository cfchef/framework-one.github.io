    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a migration release to pave the way for breaking changes in Release 3.0. All examples have been updated to latest best practices and now use cfcscript exclusively. Examples use DI/1 0.5.0 to manage all beans and services (as <code>framework.ioc</code>), and no longer rely on start/end actions or the <code>service()</code> method.<!-- more --></p>

<p>As always, FW/1 can be downloaded from the <a href="http://fw1.riaforge.org">FW/1 page on RIAForge</a>. Release 2.5 is now the latest stable release of this framework, as it approaches its fifth birthday!</p>

<p>For a full list of all tickets closed in Release 2.5: <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/issues?milestone=14&amp;page=1&amp;state=closed">https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/issues?milestone=14&amp;page=1&amp;state=closed</a></p>

<h2>Migration from 2.2.1</h2>

<p>The <code>service()</code> call has been deprecated, as have start/end action items. Global access to <code>rc</code> in <code>Application.cfc</code> has also been deprecated. If you just drop 2.5 into your setup and you rely on these features, you&rsquo;ll get exceptions explaining how to enable these features for backward compatibility, namely add the following to your framework configuration:</p>

<pre><code>enableGlobalRC = true,
suppressServiceQueue = false
</code></pre>

<p>The ability to enable the implicit service calls is still present via:</p>

<pre><code>suppressImplicitService = false
</code></pre>

<p>but, like the other two options, defaults to disallowing the deprecated feature.</p>

<p>If you enable these deprecated features, you will no longer get exceptions using them, but you will see deprecation warnings in your application server&rsquo;s console log. This is to remind you to update your code in preparation for 3.0 later this year!</p>

<p><em>Please note that Release 3.0 will completely remove these backward compatibility options &ndash; and the associated deprecated features. In addition, <code>org.corfield.framework</code> will move to <code>framework.one</code> in Release 3.0, alongside <code>framework.ioc</code>.</em></p>

    <link href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2013/12/18/fw1-2-2-released/"/>
    <updated>2013-12-18T22:34:03-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2013/12/18/fw1-2-2-released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Framework One version 2.2 is now available for production use! You can download it from the <a href="http://fw1.riaforge.org/">Framework One page on RIAForge</a>. This includes one bug fix over RC2 (interaction between <code>renderData()</code> and trace output).<!-- more --></p>

<p>The main focus of the 2.2 release is improved support for REST APIs, through the addition of <code>renderData()</code> to simplify returning JSON, XML and plain text results to the caller, as well as more sophisticated route handling via &ldquo;resource packs&rdquo; which let you define a family of related routes for a given resource type, using a shorthand notation. For more information, see this <a href="/blog/2013/11/03/fw1-releases-and-roadmap/">blog post about the latest FW/1 release and the roadmap</a>.</p>

<p>As noted previously, the master branch is the current stable release (2.2), and the develop branch has become the next release (2.5). 2.5 will be released next month and will be a stepping stone toward some substantial changes coming in 3.0. For more detail, read this <a href="/blog/2013/11/02/fw1-the-year-ahead">blog post explaining the changes coming in 2.5 and 3.0</a>.</p>

    <id>http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2013/11/03/fw1-releases-and-roadmap</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I released the first <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v2.2-rc1">FW/1 Version 2.2 Release Candidate</a> for testing. See below for the list of changes in this release, compared to Version 2.1. I also released a maintenance update for the old compatibility branch: <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v1.3">FW/1 Version 1.3</a> (the &ldquo;Latest Release&rdquo; label is due to Github&rsquo;s view of the world, but it is the latest 1.x release). This is the version to use if you&rsquo;re on CFMX 7, CF 8, CF 9.0.0, Railo versions prior to 3.2, or OpenBD.<!-- more --></p>

<p>In addition to these two releases, I also added milestones (and dates!) for the next two FW/1 releases: 2.5 and 3.0. There are some fairly big changes coming, including some important breaking changes. I&rsquo;ll post a follow-up with more details on <strong>why</strong> these changes are coming, but you should read the <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/issues/milestones">FW/1 Roadmap</a> and start thinking about how these changes will affect you (as well as reading the next blog post, of course!).</p>

<p>As always, FW/1 wouldn&rsquo;t be possible without all the contributions from the community. This version includes contributions from John Berquist (regex caching in routes, resource packs in routes), Marco Betschart, Chris Blackwell, Peter Boughton, Will Coleda, Billy Cravens, Mark Drew, and all those who have provided feedback via the mailing list and Twitter and IM and&hellip; Thank you!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a fairly complete change list for Version 2.2:</p>

<ul>
<li>#198 <code>renderData()</code> added for easier REST APIs</li>
<li>#197 resource pack support added to routes for easier REST APIs</li>
<li>#195 override <code>processRoutes()</code> to customize them (<code>addRoute()</code> is deprecated)</li>
<li>#192 regex in routes are now cached for improved performance</li>
<li>#181 improve null value support (Railo compatibility)</li>
<li>#179 can use <code>onMissingMethod()</code> for <code>injectFramework()</code></li>
<li>#176 <code>buildURL()</code> now correctly supports <code>?</code> at end of action</li>
<li>#175 subsystems automatically enabled if you specify subsystem configuration</li>
<li>#170 layout suppression is now correctly reset on an exception</li>
<li>#169 ensure <code>framework.home</code> is consistent with subsystem settings</li>
<li>#168 don&rsquo;t strip additional characters from start of path</li>
<li>#165 <code>onMissingView()</code> correctly called when view is missing</li>
<li>#163 trace code no longer fails if session scope is disabled</li>
<li>#160 <code>buildURL()</code> sanity checks <code>queryString</code> as struct</li>
</ul>


<p>Additional changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>fixed error message for service() missing action</li>
<li>framework initialization logic is more robust</li>
<li>improve example that uses DI/1 to avoid confusion over what to manage</li>
<li>improve consistency of framework injection (of itself)</li>
<li>layout trace shows correct path</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2013/01/05/fw1-version-2-1-released/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-05T13:23:53-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2013/01/05/fw1-version-2-1-released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>FW/1 2.1 is now the official master release.</p>

<p>The develop branch has been merged to master and the &lsquo;v2.1&rsquo; tag has been added. Work on version 2.2 will soon start on the develop branch.<!-- more --></p>

<p>Version 2.1 has been a long time in the works. Version 2.0 was released in December 2011, just over a year ago. So what has been going on in Framework One Land since then? You can play along at home by reading <a href="https://github.com/seancorfield/fw1/commits/master">the commit list for the master branch</a>&hellip;</p>

<p>January 2012 saw version 2.0.1 appear with a fix for <code>buildUrl("")</code> which was broken just before the 2.0 gold release and caught by Seb Duggan. Thank you. January also saw a patch from Daryl Banttari to improve the performance of <code>expandPath()</code> by caching, similar to how <code>fileExists()</code> was handled.</p>

<p>February brought the start of FW/1&rsquo;s MXUnit-based test suite with some stellar work by Ryan Anklam. Ryan continued that work in March, June and July &ndash; thank you! March brought a pull request from John Whish to improve application startup behavior in the face of errors in user code. In June, Matt Quackenbush contributed a nice improvement to <code>redirect()</code>: support for HTTP status codes. In July, Ryan Anklam contributed to <code>populate()</code>, providing the ability to handle child objects automatically, and Giancarlo Gomez enhanced the regex support in routes. In August, I fixed a bug in autowiring bean factories when using subsystems which was identified by Marco Betschart, and then Marcin Szczepanski substantially expanded the test suite throughout August, September and October &ndash; much appreciated! In October, I fixed a bug in how <code>setView()</code> interfered with error handling, identified by Alex Purice, and then I worked on the test suite and I test-drove the development of the new &ldquo;environment control&rdquo; feature. Peter Boughton spotted that <code>setLayout()</code> did not work inside <code>onMissingView()</code> so I test-drove a fix for that. I added the <code>unhandledExceptionCaught</code> option so you can choose to rely on FW/1 for handling errors in requests that would otherwise be &lsquo;unhandled&rsquo; by the framework (thanks to &lsquo;stubotnik&rsquo; for that suggestion). Dave Ferguson identified a nasty bug in ColdFusion 10&rsquo;s WebSocket implementation that was causing him problems with FW/1 &ndash; which I fixed by copying <code>CGI</code> variables to the <code>request</code> scope. I cleaned up <code>request</code> scope usage and further improved FW/1&rsquo;s robustness in the face of errors at startup, due to user code problems. In November, Richard Herbert found a case where FW/1 failed if <code>session</code> scope was disabled (now fixed). December was then a busy month with the addition of the new tracing / debugging facility, ensuring HTTP status code 500 is set when an unhandled exception is reported, and various small bug fixes and code cleanup in the new features added. Thanx there to Nando Breiter, Marcin Szczepanski and Chris Blackwell for finding those bugs!</p>

<p>Thank you everyone for your contributions to FW/1 &ndash; I really appreciate the assistance in making the framework better for its community! As can be seen above, it really is a team effort.</p>

<p>In summary then, version 2.1 contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>Environment Control support.</li>
<li>Application tracing.</li>
<li><code>populate()</code> now handles child objects automatically.</li>
<li>Improved regex support in routes.</li>
<li>Addition of a nice test suite, making it easier to test-drive the development of new features, as well as ensure fewer regression bugs sneak in.</li>
<li><code>request</code> scope cleanup (and removal of several <code>request</code> variables that had previously been marked as deprecated.</li>
<li>Lots of small improvements to the robustness of application startup in the face of user code problems, making it easier to debug those problems, and several enhancements to error handling in general.</li>
</ul>
