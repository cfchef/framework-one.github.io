    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.5.0-beta1">first Beta release of FW/1 3.5.0</a> is available for testing.</p>

<p>The focus of this release is integration:<!--more--></p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for controllers and services to be written in CFML (<code>.cfc</code>), Clojure (<code>.clj</code>), or Lucee (<code>.lucee</code>)</li>
  <li>Support for views and layouts to be written in CFML (<code>.cfm</code>) or Lucee (<code>.lucee</code>)</li>
  <li>Configurable folder names to set your own conventions (for <em>controllers</em>, <em>layouts</em>, <em>subsystems</em>, and <em>views</em>)</li>
  <li>Support for <code>Application.cfc</code> to use FW/1 without extending <code>framework.one</code></li>
  <li>A new, cleaner, more consistent set of conventions for adding subsystems to an existing application</li>
</ul>

<p>You can read the <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.5+is%3Aclosed">full list of changes since 3.0</a> on GitHub.</p>

<p>The <a href="/documentation/3.5/">documentation for 3.5</a> has been completely overhauled with complete descriptions of all the new features, as well as many
clarifications and expansions of existing features. In particular, you’ll want to check out:</p>

    <updated>2015-09-06T23:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/09/06/out-of-the-box</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>FW/1 is up on <a href="http://www.coldbox.org/forgebox">ForgeBox</a>. ForgeBox is the npm / Maven of the CFML world. If you haven’t heard about it – or you think it’s only for “Box” products – you need to check it out! It’s a repository for CFML projects that can be easily installed via <a href="https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox">Command Box</a>. Wait! You haven’t heard of that either? Gosh, you’ve got some reading to do! It’ll change the way you do development!</p>

<p>Go get it installed, then read on!<!--more--></p>

<p>Now you have <code>box</code> installed, here’s how to get up and running with FW/1 easily:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; box
CommandBox:mydir&gt; install fw1-commands
... you only need to do this once ...
CommandBox:mydir&gt; mkdir example
CommandBox:mydir&gt; cd example
CommandBox:example&gt; fw1 create app example basic
CommandBox:example&gt; install fw1
... installs stable 3.1.2 version ...
CommandBox:example&gt; start
</code></pre>

<p>At this point it’ll open a browser running your new skeleton FW/1 app. Happy coding!</p>

<p>Note that you don’t need to have installed a CFML server, or set up a webroot - <code>box</code> can start a CFML server in any directory so you can get up and running quickly!</p>

<p>You can check out the various <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1-commands">FW/1 commands</a> available inside <code>box</code> but, like Ruby on Rails, they let you quickly add new controllers, views, subsystems and so on to your application. Huge kudos to Tony Junkes for contributing this to the FW/1 family of projects!</p>

<p>Going forward, my plan is that <code>install fw1</code> will always install the current stable (master) version — I just need to remember to keep it up to date! — and you can also install specific versions (currently <code>fw1-3.1.2</code> and <code>fw1-3.5.0</code>). The latter installs from the develop branch. Support for true multiple version installs is planned for <code>box</code>, possibly next month.</p>

<p>One of the things that is really nice about this is you can switch FW/1 versions as easily as:</p>

<pre><code>CommandBox:example&gt; uninstall fw1
CommandBox:example&gt; install fw1-3.5.0
</code></pre>

<p>Now your app is running 3.5.0 (Alpha 2) instead of the stable release!</p>

    <link href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/09/06/fw1-news/"/>
    <updated>2015-09-06T22:25:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/09/06/fw1-news</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of months have passed since <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/07/12/fw1-3-1-released/">FW/1 3.1 was released</a> but things have been busy behind the scenes!</p>

<p>As indicated in July, work on FW/1 3.5 had been progressing in parallel (the first time two releases of FW/1 have been worked on concurrently!) and you can already download <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.5.0-alpha2">FW/1 3.5 Alpha 2</a>.
Yes, there was an <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.5.0-alpha1">Alpha 1</a> as well, but as work progressed on the <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/3.5/">massively overhauled 3.5 documentation</a>, some important usability enhancements
appeared and a new alpha was released within 24 hours! In particular, the <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/3.5/cfml-and-clojure.html">Clojure and CFML Sitting in a Tree</a> section has been extensively updated and includes a fully worked example of
how to create FW/1 application from scratch using the REPL to create Clojure services and controllers, with CFML views and layouts!</p>

<p>You’ll also probably notice that the FW/1 website has had a facelift, finally getting the look’n’feel that Kevin Stannard designed five years ago. Better late than never, and huge thanks to Kevin again for his wonderful logo design and choice of colors!
The 3.5 documentation now includes a table of contents on each page, making it easier to navigate (this will probably get backported to 3.1 and 3.0 at some point).</p>

<p>In addition to the ongoing work on FW/1 3.5, we also have an <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.1.1">important bug fix release for the 3.1.x version</a> which addresses a potential problem with REST APIs.</p>

<p>Finally, if you’re a <a href="https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox">CommandBox</a> fan, we have good news: you can now easily install FW/1 3.1.2 and 3.5.0 (prerelease) via <code>box</code>. I’ll be blogging about this shortly. The 3.1.2 release is exactly the same as 3.1.1 (including the version number!)
but it includes <code>box.json</code> for compatibility with ForgeBox / CommandBox. In addition, Tony Junkes has contributed an <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1-commands">initial set of <code>box</code> commands for FW/1</a> that let you get up and running quickly. This will be covered in the next blog post.</p>

    <link href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/07/12/fw1-3-1-released/"/>
    <updated>2015-07-12T20:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/07/12/fw1-3-1-released</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The “gold” release of FW/1 3.1 (3.1.0) is now available for production use! You can <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.1.0">download FW/1 3.1.0 from GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>FW 3.1 is a maintenance release of the 3.x series, containing a number of bug fixes and enhancements. The main new feature of release 3.1 is the addition of AOP/1, thanks to the tireless work of <a href="https://github.com/dbudde">Daniel Budde</a>.<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="aop1">AOP/1</h2>
<p>AOP/1 brings Aspect-Oriented Programming to FW/1 applications by extending the capabilities of DI/1 with “interceptors” that can be automatically woven into your beans to allow you to call additional methods before, after, or instead of (“around”) the native methods on your beans.
Please read <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/using-aop-one.html">the all new AOP/1 documentation</a> provided by Daniel Budde for more details on how to use this powerful new feature.</p>

<h2 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h2>

<ul>
  <li><code>renderData()</code> now supports both <code>html</code>, <code>rawjson</code> and <code>jsonp</code> data types.</li>
  <li><code>redirect()</code> now supports a <code>header</code> argument to allow for custom redirect-like behavior such as might be needed in a Single-Page-Application or heavy ajax usage.</li>
  <li>Routes:
    <ul>
      <li>Regex support for <code>^</code> to anchor the match to the start of the request string.</li>
      <li>Placeholders can now have matches restricted by regex patterns (e.g., to match numeric-only portions of the request string).</li>
      <li>Regex matching can now be made case-sensitive via the new <code>routesCaseSensitive</code> option.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Per-subsystem configuration now supports <code>diEngine</code>, <code>diComponent</code>, <code>diLocations</code>, and <code>diConfig</code>.</li>
  <li>Per-environment configuration is now merged recursively, including appropriate parts of <code>diConfig</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Route matching for placeholders was too eager. Placeholder names are now restricted to alphanumeric plus <code>_</code> and <code>-</code> characters only. <em>This is potentially a breaking change if you have used unusual characters in placeholder variable names that are legal in CFML identifiers!</em></li>
  <li>If the first request to an application was also a reload request, initialization was sometimes attempted twice if an exception was thrown during initialization.</li>
  <li>Framework reloads were not always thread safe and could produce strange behavior if an application was reloaded under load.</li>
  <li>DI/1’s <code>isConstant()</code> method could fail for manually created and managed beans.</li>
  <li><code>Application.cfc</code> was not always correctly autowired as a Controller.</li>
  <li>If content had been produced in a request that used <code>renderData()</code>, that content could corrupt the result. A content reset is now performed in such cases.</li>
  <li>DI/1 no longer attempts to instantiate interfaces that it discovers in the model.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="platform-support">Platform Support</h2>

<ul>
  <li>ColdFusion 9.0.1 and Railo 4.0 are no longer officially supported by FW/1. FW/1 3.1 applications will probably still run on them but there are some bugs in both engine versions that can impact some of the new functionality in this release.
FW/1 3.1 officially supports ColdFusion 9.0.2 or later, Railo 4.1 or later, and Lucee 4.5.1.000 or later.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>As part of my commitment to diversity in IT, Framework One now has a <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a> that encompasses all aspects of interaction with the project: on GitHub, on the mailing list, and in presentations given by community members to promote the framework.
This brings Framework in line with a number of progressive open source projects that have adopted a Code of Conduct as a way to make the open source software community more welcoming and more inclusive.</p>

<h2 id="contributors">Contributors</h2>
<p>The star contributor for this release is <a href="https://github.com/dbudde">Daniel Budde</a> for rewriting AOP/1 (twice!) so it is ready for inclusion with FW/1! Thank you!</p>

<p>Other contributors, in alphabetical order of GitHub name:</p>

<ul>
  <li>atuttle - Adam Tuttle</li>
  <li>cybersonic - Mark Drew</li>
  <li>GiancarloGomez - Giancarlo Gomez</li>
  <li>guillaume-boivin - Guillaume Boivin</li>
  <li>jcberquist - John Berquist</li>
  <li>jochemd - Jochem van Dieten</li>
  <li>Ronner</li>
  <li>ryanguill - Ryan Guill</li>
</ul>

<p>And, yeah, I did a bit too, but FW/1 wouldn’t be where it is today without contributions from the open source CFML community - thank you everyone!</p>

<h2 id="additional-information">Additional Information</h2>
<p>For a complete list of changes since 3.0:</p>

    <link href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/07/07/fw1-3-1-rc-2/"/>
    <updated>2015-07-07T16:40:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/07/07/fw1-3-1-rc-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The second Release Candidate of FW/1 3.1 is now available for testing. You <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.1-rc2">download FW/1 3.1 RC 2 from GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>These are the changes since RC 1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Major overhaul of AOP/1; intercept by CFC type; intercept by CFC name regex (Daniel Budde).</li>
  <li>Routes now support regex restriction on placeholder variables (Guillaume Boivin).</li>
</ul>

<p>For a complete list of changes since 3.0:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A3.1">Issues Closed</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A3.1">Pull Requests Merged</a></li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, release 3.1 should be considered “production ready” and only critical bug fixes will be included between now and the “gold” release. It is the default download on RIAForge and will be merged to master tomorrow in preparation for the final release at the weekend.</p>

<p>As noted before, release 3.5 will follow fairly quickly after that, with a focus on language integration, bringing
automatic support for Clojure code in the Model and Controllers, as well as first class support for the Lucee Language in the Model, the Views, and the Controllers.</p>
