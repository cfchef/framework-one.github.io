    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.5.0-rc2">second Release Candidate of FW/1 3.5.0</a> is available for testing.</p>

<p>This Release Candidate contains a few bug fixes discovered since Release Candidate 1 and is now the <a href="http://fw1.riaforge.org">default download from FW/1’s RIAForge page</a>.
I consider this stable enough to evaluate for production usage at this point – I expect this RC to be the Gold Release unless end user testing uncovers a showstopping issue in the next week or two!</p>

<p>This Release Candidate contains just bug fixes since Beta 2. Beta 2 contained mostly bug fixes since Beta 1, with one small enhancement to DI/1 (<code>liberal</code> plural support, e.g., <code>libraries</code> becomes <code>library</code>).</p>

<p>The focus of this release is integration:<!--more--></p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for controllers and services to be written in CFML (<code>.cfc</code>), Clojure (<code>.clj</code>), or Lucee (<code>.lucee</code>)</li>
  <li>Support for views and layouts to be written in CFML (<code>.cfm</code>) or Lucee (<code>.lucee</code>)</li>
  <li>Configurable folder names to set your own conventions (for <em>controllers</em>, <em>layouts</em>, <em>subsystems</em>, and <em>views</em>)</li>
  <li>Support for <code>Application.cfc</code> to use FW/1 without extending <code>framework.one</code></li>
  <li>A new, cleaner, more consistent set of conventions for adding subsystems to an existing application</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="/documentation/3.5/">documentation for 3.5</a> has been completely overhauled with complete descriptions of all the new features, as well as many
clarifications and expansions of existing features. In particular, you’ll want to check out:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/documentation/3.5/developing-applications.html#alternative-application-structure">Alternative Application Structure</a></li>
  <li><a href="/documentation/3.5/using-subsystems.html#subsystems-10-vs-20">Subsystems 1.0 vs 2.0</a></li>

    <updated>2015-09-06T23:00:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/09/06/out-of-the-box</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>FW/1 is up on <a href="http://www.coldbox.org/forgebox">ForgeBox</a>. ForgeBox is the npm / Maven of the CFML world. If you haven’t heard about it – or you think it’s only for “Box” products – you need to check it out! It’s a repository for CFML projects that can be easily installed via <a href="https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox">Command Box</a>. Wait! You haven’t heard of that either? Gosh, you’ve got some reading to do! It’ll change the way you do development!</p>

<p>Go get it installed, then read on!<!--more--></p>

<p>Now you have <code>box</code> installed, here’s how to get up and running with FW/1 easily:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; box
CommandBox:mydir&gt; install fw1-commands
... you only need to do this once ...
CommandBox:mydir&gt; mkdir example
CommandBox:mydir&gt; cd example
CommandBox:example&gt; fw1 create app example basic
CommandBox:example&gt; install fw1
... installs stable 3.1.2 version ...
CommandBox:example&gt; start
</code></pre>

<p>At this point it’ll open a browser running your new skeleton FW/1 app. Happy coding!</p>

<p>Note that you don’t need to have installed a CFML server, or set up a webroot - <code>box</code> can start a CFML server in any directory so you can get up and running quickly!</p>

<p>You can check out the various <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1-commands">FW/1 commands</a> available inside <code>box</code> but, like Ruby on Rails, they let you quickly add new controllers, views, subsystems and so on to your application. Huge kudos to Tony Junkes for contributing this to the FW/1 family of projects!</p>

<p>Going forward, my plan is that <code>install fw1</code> will always install the current stable (master) version — I just need to remember to keep it up to date! — and you can also install specific versions (currently <code>fw1-3.1.2</code> and <code>fw1-3.5.0</code>). The latter installs from the develop branch. Support for true multiple version installs is planned for <code>box</code>, possibly next month.</p>

<p>One of the things that is really nice about this is you can switch FW/1 versions as easily as:</p>

<pre><code>CommandBox:example&gt; uninstall fw1
CommandBox:example&gt; install fw1-3.5.0
</code></pre>

<p>Now your app is running 3.5.0 (Alpha 2) instead of the stable release!</p>

    <link href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/09/06/fw1-news/"/>
    <updated>2015-09-06T22:25:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/09/06/fw1-news</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of months have passed since <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/07/12/fw1-3-1-released/">FW/1 3.1 was released</a> but things have been busy behind the scenes!</p>

<p>As indicated in July, work on FW/1 3.5 had been progressing in parallel (the first time two releases of FW/1 have been worked on concurrently!) and you can already download <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.5.0-alpha2">FW/1 3.5 Alpha 2</a>.
Yes, there was an <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.5.0-alpha1">Alpha 1</a> as well, but as work progressed on the <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/3.5/">massively overhauled 3.5 documentation</a>, some important usability enhancements
appeared and a new alpha was released within 24 hours! In particular, the <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/3.5/cfml-and-clojure.html">Clojure and CFML Sitting in a Tree</a> section has been extensively updated and includes a fully worked example of
how to create FW/1 application from scratch using the REPL to create Clojure services and controllers, with CFML views and layouts!</p>

<p>You’ll also probably notice that the FW/1 website has had a facelift, finally getting the look’n’feel that Kevin Stannard designed five years ago. Better late than never, and huge thanks to Kevin again for his wonderful logo design and choice of colors!
The 3.5 documentation now includes a table of contents on each page, making it easier to navigate (this will probably get backported to 3.1 and 3.0 at some point).</p>

<p>In addition to the ongoing work on FW/1 3.5, we also have an <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.1.1">important bug fix release for the 3.1.x version</a> which addresses a potential problem with REST APIs.</p>

<p>Finally, if you’re a <a href="https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox">CommandBox</a> fan, we have good news: you can now easily install FW/1 3.1.2 and 3.5.0 (prerelease) via <code>box</code>. I’ll be blogging about this shortly. The 3.1.2 release is exactly the same as 3.1.1 (including the version number!)
but it includes <code>box.json</code> for compatibility with ForgeBox / CommandBox. In addition, Tony Junkes has contributed an <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1-commands">initial set of <code>box</code> commands for FW/1</a> that let you get up and running quickly. This will be covered in the next blog post.</p>
