    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.5.0">Gold Release of FW/1 3.5.0</a> is available for general release and production use. The focus of this release is integration, bringing an improved way to add subsystems to an existing application, an easier way to add FW/1 to a legacy application, support for mixed CFML / Clojure applications, better support for WireBox, and full support for ForgeBox and CommandBox!<!-- more --></p>

<p>The major new features in FW/1 3.5.0 are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Subsystems 2.0. A new, more streamlined way to add subsystems to an existing FW/1 application has been added. Thank you to <a href="https://github.com/sneiland">Steven Neiland</a> for the inspiration and guiding principles! Read about <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/using-subsystems.html">Subsystems 2.0</a> and how they differ from the older approach (which is still supported). The examples have been reworked to use Subsystems 2.0 so you can see how it works in practice.</li>
  <li>An <strong>Alternative Application Structure</strong> is now supported that allows you to create FW/1 applications that do not require <code>Application.cfc</code> extends the FW/1 component. Read about <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/developing-applications.html#alternative-application-structure">the Alternative Application Structure</a>. Some of the examples have been updated to use this approach so you can see how it works in practice.</li>
  <li>Clojure integration. If you have Leiningen installed (Clojure’s build tool) then it is very easy to write services and/or controllers in Clojure and have FW/1 automatically integrate those into your CFML application. Read about <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/cfml-and-clojure.html">mixing CFML &amp; Clojure</a> for more details. An example of Clojure integration is provided in the repository (you’ll need <a href="http://leiningen.org">Leiningen</a> installed for that example to run).</li>
  <li>ForgeBox / CommandBox support. FW/1 now has a <code>box.json</code> file and is hosted on ForgeBox so it can be easily installed via CommandBox.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the major features, the following enhancements have been added:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>redirect()</code> allows <code>queryString</code> to be a struct, like <code>buildURL()</code>.</li>
  <li><code>isFrameworkReloadRequest()</code> is now public in case an application needs to take action when the framework is reloaded.</li>
  <li><code>getSubsystemSectionAndItem()</code> added to supplement <code>getFullyQualifiedAction()</code> (the latter omits the subsystem if it is empty).</li>
  <li>The WireBox adapter now supports custom binders.</li>
  <li>The conventions used for various folder names can now be overridden in the framework configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p>And the following bugs have been fixed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/issues/377">377</a> - AOP/1 now allows a single interceptor to be applied to multiple objects.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/issues/361">361</a> - <code>renderData()</code> could kill sessions (this was backported to 3.1.1).</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/issues/336">336</a> - account for <code>expandPath()</code> returning the wrong directory on ACF11 when the path has a trailing <code>/</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, FW/1 includes experimental support for Lucee Language, so if you are running a prerelease build of Lucee Server that has Lucee Language support enabled, you can write controllers and views etc in <code>.lc</code> or <code>.lucee</code> files and FW/1 will use them.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.5.0-rc2">second Release Candidate of FW/1 3.5.0</a> is available for testing.</p>

<p>This Release Candidate contains a few bug fixes discovered since Release Candidate 1 and is now the <a href="http://fw1.riaforge.org">default download from FW/1’s RIAForge page</a>.
I consider this stable enough to evaluate for production usage at this point – I expect this RC to be the Gold Release unless end user testing uncovers a showstopping issue in the next week or two!</p>

<p>This Release Candidate contains just bug fixes since Beta 2. Beta 2 contained mostly bug fixes since Beta 1, with one small enhancement to DI/1 (<code>liberal</code> plural support, e.g., <code>libraries</code> becomes <code>library</code>).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for controllers and services to be written in CFML (<code>.cfc</code>), Clojure (<code>.clj</code>), or Lucee (<code>.lucee</code>)</li>
  <li>Support for views and layouts to be written in CFML (<code>.cfm</code>) or Lucee (<code>.lucee</code>)</li>

  <li>Support for <code>Application.cfc</code> to use FW/1 without extending <code>framework.one</code></li>
  <li>A new, cleaner, more consistent set of conventions for adding subsystems to an existing application</li>

<p>The <a href="/documentation/3.5/">documentation for 3.5</a> has been completely overhauled with complete descriptions of all the new features, as well as many
clarifications and expansions of existing features. In particular, you’ll want to check out:</p>

    <link href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/09/06/fw1-news/"/>
    <updated>2015-09-06T22:25:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/09/06/fw1-news</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple of months have passed since <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/07/12/fw1-3-1-released/">FW/1 3.1 was released</a> but things have been busy behind the scenes!</p>

<p>As indicated in July, work on FW/1 3.5 had been progressing in parallel (the first time two releases of FW/1 have been worked on concurrently!) and you can already download <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.5.0-alpha2">FW/1 3.5 Alpha 2</a>.
Yes, there was an <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.5.0-alpha1">Alpha 1</a> as well, but as work progressed on the <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/3.5/">massively overhauled 3.5 documentation</a>, some important usability enhancements
appeared and a new alpha was released within 24 hours! In particular, the <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/3.5/cfml-and-clojure.html">Clojure and CFML Sitting in a Tree</a> section has been extensively updated and includes a fully worked example of
how to create FW/1 application from scratch using the REPL to create Clojure services and controllers, with CFML views and layouts!</p>

<p>You’ll also probably notice that the FW/1 website has had a facelift, finally getting the look’n’feel that Kevin Stannard designed five years ago. Better late than never, and huge thanks to Kevin again for his wonderful logo design and choice of colors!
The 3.5 documentation now includes a table of contents on each page, making it easier to navigate (this will probably get backported to 3.1 and 3.0 at some point).</p>

<p>In addition to the ongoing work on FW/1 3.5, we also have an <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.1.1">important bug fix release for the 3.1.x version</a> which addresses a potential problem with REST APIs.</p>

<p>Finally, if you’re a <a href="https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox">CommandBox</a> fan, we have good news: you can now easily install FW/1 3.1.2 and 3.5.0 (prerelease) via <code>box</code>. I’ll be blogging about this shortly. The 3.1.2 release is exactly the same as 3.1.1 (including the version number!)
but it includes <code>box.json</code> for compatibility with ForgeBox / CommandBox. In addition, Tony Junkes has contributed an <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1-commands">initial set of <code>box</code> commands for FW/1</a> that let you get up and running quickly. This will be covered in the next blog post.</p>
