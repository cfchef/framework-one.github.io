    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I released FW/1 3.0 about a month ago and now it&rsquo;s time to get started on the 3.1 release.<!-- more --></p>

<p>FW/1 3.1 will be primarily a maintenance release. You can read the <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/milestones/3.1">current list of changes slated for FW/1 3.1</a> on the GitHub issues page. Depending on how long it takes to get 3.1 done, additional issues may be added. And, of course, some of these issues may be slipped to 3.5 (currently represented by the <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/tree/clojure">Clojure branch of FW/1</a> in the GitHub repo and the <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/milestones/3.5">short list of FW/1 3.5 issues</a>).</p>

<p>Starting with release 3.0, the <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/">FW/1 documentation</a> will be versioned and the top-level page will always represent the latest version in development. You can read the <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/3.0/">FW/1 3.0 documentation</a> separately already. The sidebar will always show two releases (develop and master) fully linked &ndash; older versions will be listed in future, with just a link to the index page.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m pleased to announce that after lots of user testing and almost no issues found, the Gold Release of <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.0">FW/1 3.0</a> is now available!<!-- more --></p>

<p>About two and a half weeks ago I released <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/02/06/fw1-3-0-rc-2-available/">FW/1 3.0 RC 2</a> and only one minor issue was reported (an inconsistency between <code>buildURL()</code> and <code>buildCustomURL()</code> regarding how <code>baseURL</code> was handled). That has been fixed, along with the addition of a new extension point for DI/1 (<code>metadata()</code>).</p>

<p>You can see a <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/issues?milestone=13&amp;q=is%3Aclosed">full list of issues fixed in FW/1 for 3.0</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/di1/issues?milestone=1&amp;q=is%3Aclosed">full list of issues fixed in DI/1 1.0</a> on GitHub. This represents the official release of DI/1 1.0 as well.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who has contributed to the 3.0 release &ndash; it&rsquo;s been a long time in the making! Particular thanks go to Nando Breiter for migrating the DI/1 documentation from the old wiki to the new FW/1 website. Also thanks to John Berquist, Ryan Guill, Cameron Childress, and Adam Tuttle for you code contributions and everyone who tested prerelease builds of FW/1 and reported issues and made suggestions! Thank you!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About two weeks ago I released <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/01/24/fw1-3-0-rc-1-available/">FW/1 3.0 RC 1</a> and the only real bug persisting at that point was related to <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/issues/283">DI/1 dotted path deduction</a>.</p>

<p>I think that bug is finally squashed, based on early testing by some users that had encountered the bug, so the second <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.0-rc2">Release Candidate build</a> of FW/1 3.0 is now available!<!-- more --></p>

<p>In addition to fixing that DI/1 bug, the only other change since RC 1 is some cleanup of the <code>examples</code> folder. That means this RC is almost certainly going to be gold candidate for the final 3.0 release.</p>

<p>Please download and test this version and report any issues you find. I&rsquo;d like to cut the final 3.0 release fairly soon, so I can merge <code>develop</code> to <code>master</code> and start planning FW/1 3.5.</p>

    <id>http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/01/29/lucee-fw1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today saw the announcement of the <a href="http://lucee.org">Lucee Association Switzerland</a> and the release of a new open source CFML engine: <a href="http://lucee.org/downloads.html">Lucee 4.5.0</a>.</p>

<p>For background on the new engine and the association behind it, read <a href="http://blog.adamcameron.me/2015/01/lucee.html">Adam Cameron&rsquo;s blog post with Q&amp;A</a> about the launch.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already migrated all my local test environments to Lucee and can report that FW/1 (and DI/1 and cfmljure) all run beautifully on it &ndash; and it will be my primary test environment for future development of the FW/1 family going forward.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also migrated my local dev environment for World Singles over to Lucee and that went pretty smoothly too (I encountered just two issues &ndash; both minor, one already fixed in Lucee&rsquo;s master repository).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://bitbucket.org/lucee/lucee/wiki/Home">Lucee wiki</a> has information about downloading and installing Lucee, as well as building Lucee from source, and how to migrate from Railo to Lucee (hint: it&rsquo;s really easy &ndash; stop the server, remove <code>railo.jar</code>, add <code>lucee.jar</code>, start the server).</p>

<p>Have fun with Lucee!</p>

    <link href="http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/01/24/fw1-3-0-rc-1-available/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-24T22:21:49-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://framework-one.github.io/blog/2015/01/24/fw1-3-0-rc-1-available</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>FW/1 3.0 has been in beta testing since August 2014 and lots of people are already running in production so I figured it was time to push out the first <a href="https://github.com/framework-one/fw1/releases/tag/v3.0-rc1">Release Candidate build</a>.</p>

<p>The main focus of RC 1 has been bug fixes. Only a small number of functional enhancements have been added (notably <code>getEnvVar()</code> to retrieve the value of a system environment variable which can be useful during environment control processing).<!-- more --> Some deprecated features have been removed:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>getRC()</code> and <code>getRCValue()</code> have been removed, along with the configuration flag that had been enabling them. They were a hasty addition at the end of the 2.5 cycle and they were a mistake &ndash; if you&rsquo;re using them, you&rsquo;re doing something wrong!</li>
<li><code>org.corfield.framework</code> is no longer supported &ndash; use <code>framework.one</code> instead. It was always a questionable choice of file path for the framework and I&rsquo;ve been tempted to change it several times. The 3.0 cycle deprecated it and moved the framework CFC to the <code>/framework</code> folder, where DI/1 has lived since the 2.5 cycle. This is probably a <strong>breaking change</strong> unless you&rsquo;ve been using prerelease builds of 3.0 and have already eliminated the deprecation warnings!</li>
</ul>


<p>In addition, AOP/1 is no longer bundled with FW/1. It&rsquo;s not ready for primetime yet so I didn&rsquo;t want to include it in the 3.0 release. It got a lot of work between Alpha 1 and Beta 1 but additional bugs and some hard problems came up in testing. It&rsquo;s still available on the <code>aop1</code> branch if you want to experiment with it (and help find and fix more bugs in it!).</p>

<p>As part of the preparation for RC 1, all of the documentation has been reviewed and updated and DI/1&rsquo;s documentation is now <a href="http://framework-one.github.io/documentation/using-di-one.html">part of the main documentation site</a>. Big thanks go to Nando Breiter for bringing that across from the old wiki in the standalone DI/1 repo. Code contributors to RC 1 include: John Berquist, Ryan Guill, Cameron Childress. Thank you!</p>

<p>At this point, only bug fixes will be considered before FW/1 3.0 goes &ldquo;gold&rdquo; and given the long period of testing so far on Beta 1, that final release shouldn&rsquo;t be too far away.</p>

<p>Oh, and if you go to <a href="http://fw1.riaforge.org">FW/1&rsquo;s page on RIAForge</a>, you&rsquo;ll see that 3.0 RC 1 is the default download now, instead of 2.5.</p>
